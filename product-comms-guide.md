# Product Communications Framework and Guide

Create compelling communications based on your technical truth. Brought to you by [Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/).

## Introduction: How do we write better content for technology products? 

Technology products require a modular and agile approach to writing. Have you ever had a set of LEGO bricks that you played around with to create a plane, house, or skyscraper? We think about Product Communication similarly. We choose from a set of communication components to develop and shape the different Product Communications content you need: blogs, sales enablement assets, landing pages, and more.

Product Communications make clear your product’s value to technical and business audiences. In our approach, you should create communications assets from factual components based on a solid technical and strategic foundation, your “technical truth.”

- **Communications Assets** include webpages like product-, service- or persona pages, Value Maps, Product Data Sheets, and more.
- **Product Communication Components** include micro-copy, like taglines and CTAs, as well as longer text elements, like [positioning statements](#c4336) and [Value Cases](#c4342). (More on these later in this document.)

## Before we start, some technical communication values to write by

### Empathy
- **Put yourself in your audience’s shoes** to understand their challenges, needs, and context.
- **Use language that will resonate** with your audience, e.g., business terms for business readers and technical terms for developers.
- **Pitch your writing to your audience, but help others learn.** No one will hold against you explaining jargon and technical terminology, and you will help people new to your topic get up to speed.

### Clarity
- **Translate complicated and abstract technology concepts** into clear, compelling product communication.
- **Clearly structured writing and assets are more easily consumed** and, therefore, more effective. See our Writing and Editing Guide for more on formatting: headers, lists, avoiding walls of text, etc.  

### Trust
- **Empathy, clarity, and accuracy help build trust.**
- **Show that you understand your reader’s challenges.** They will identify themselves in your writing, trust you more, and keep reading.
- **Be transparent and honest about what you can’t offer** to build trust. Don’t sell vaporware ;-).
- **Avoid hyperbole.** It totally, massively, always helps, too.
- **Use (and explain) technical terminology accurately** to build trust.

## Our Product Communication Principles

The Product Communications Framework follows our [Writing and Editing Guide](https://openstrategypartners.com/osp-writing-editing-guide/).

### The best (most effective) product communications are:
1. **Tight:** *Every word takes up precious real estate. Make them count.*
2. **Specific:** *Use the most precise version of a word or phrase. Don’t generalize or be vague.*
3. **Accurate:** *Make factual statements supported by evidence.*
4. **Clean and Consistent:** *Grammar, spelling, style, and tone should be professional and consistent with your voice and tone.*
5. **Compelling:** *Tell stories. Use words, verbs, rhythm, and language that resonate.*
6. **Functional:** *A text has a job to do. Make sure it’s doing it.*

All the Value Map components are also components we use in Product Communications. The Value Map process produces the communication components you need to create content assets for your B2B product or service. Use the Value Map as your single source of truth to build communication assets, following our communication values and principles.

To learn more about the intersection of Product Communications and the OSP Value Map, see [Product Communications and the Value Map](#c4333) in this guide.

## Tips for effective content writing for your tech

“Good” Product Communications applies these principles at every scope, from the smallest (e.g., a tagline or caption) to the largest (e.g., whole pages, websites, or campaigns).






Writing content for technical products can be daunting, but focusing on clarity, empathy, and trust makes it easier. Follow these tips:

1. **Know your audience:** Understand their needs, challenges, and interests.
2. **Write clear, concise headlines:** Use 2-8 word taglines that capture attention.
3. **Emphasize benefits over features:** Explain how your product solves problems, not just what it does.
4. **Use consistent terminology:** Avoid introducing confusion by using multiple terms for the same concept.
5. **Tell a story:** Craft narratives that resonate emotionally with readers.

## How do I know what to write? The OSP Value Map

The OSP Value Map helps identify the core values of your product or service, serving as the foundation for all your communication assets. It bridges the gap between technical truths and audience expectations.

- **Value Cases:** Explain specific solutions to audience challenges.
- **Taglines:** Short phrases that encapsulate the product’s essence.
- **Positioning Statements:** Provide strategic clarity on what makes your product unique.

## Definitions, Best Practices, and Examples: Product Communication Components

### Trust
- **Empathy, clarity, and accuracy help build trust.**
- **Show that you understand your reader’s challenges.** They will identify themselves in your writing, trust you more, and keep reading.
- **Be transparent and honest about what you can’t offer** to build trust. Don’t sell vaporware ;-).
- **Avoid hyperbole.** It totally, massively, always helps, too.
- **Use (and explain) technical terminology accurately** to build trust.

### How Do I Know What to Write? The OSP Value Map
The OSP Value Map is a methodology and toolkit we use for content ideation and insight generation. Once yours is up and running, you'll never be stuck for content ideas again.

We typically start most engagements with a Value Map (VM) of the client product or service we are working on. To create your VM, together with you and your stakeholders, we:
1. Conduct a deep technical analysis of your offering.
2. Capture all its features.
3. Organize the features into logical-functional groupings.
4. Map the relationships between the functionalities and the business value they deliver.

You get a comprehensive inventory of the following modular components and entities from which we can create messaging, positioning, and content assets.

**Product-based VM Component/Entity Hierarchy:**
- **Product (or Service)**
  - Tagline
  - Positioning Statement
  - USPs
  - Solution Statements
- **Feature Category**
  - Name
  - Tagline
  - Value Case
    - Benefit
    - Challenge
    - Solution
- **Feature Area**
  - Name
  - Tagline
  - Value Case
    - Benefit
    - Challenge
    - Solution
- **Feature**

## Definitions, best practices, and examples: product communication components

### Taglines: 2-8 Word Headlines
#### What is a tagline, and what is its purpose?
Taglines are short sentences or fragments, typically found at the top of the page or as section headers. Their purpose is to grab attention while introducing the content that follows. They are often the most verbally playful and brand-driven statements.

#### Tagline Examples
- *Free and open, it’s our heart* ([Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/))
- *Marketing smarts for big ideas* ([Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/))
- *Work on big ideas without the busywork.* ([Asana](https://asana.com/))
- *Your tech is complex. Your message shouldn’t be.* ([Open Strategy Partners](https://openstrategypartners.com/))

#### Tagline Best Practices
- Keep taglines short and rhythmic.
- Experiment with alliteration, wordplay, and rhyming.
- Feel free to use fragments.
- Capture brand character and values.
- Make taglines clever, attention-grabbing, and stand out.
- Look for opportunities for interplay between tagline, graphics, and context.

## Brand and Product Positioning Statements

### What is a positioning statement?
Positioning statements describe a product or brand's unique value to its audience. These are typically concise yet compelling sentences or short paragraphs that explain who the product is for, what it does, and how it differentiates itself from competitors.

---

### Elements of a Strong Positioning Statement
- **Target Audience:** Identify the intended users or customers.
- **Key Benefits:** Highlight the specific value your product provides.
- **Differentiation:** Explain what makes your product or service unique.
- **Proof Points:** Support your claims with data, testimonials, or other evidence.

#### Example Positioning Statement:
*"For technology teams needing fast and secure deployment pipelines, DevOpsX offers automated workflows and seamless integration with popular tools, enabling teams to ship better code faster. Unlike traditional CI/CD systems, DevOpsX features intuitive interfaces and a flexible pricing model."*

---

### Best Practices for Writing Positioning Statements
1. Focus on clarity and conciseness.
2. Write for your target audience.
3. Highlight how your product solves specific problems.
4. Use precise, jargon-free language.
5. Test your positioning statement with a sample audience.

## Features, Feature Areas, and Feature Categories

### Features
**What is a Feature, and what is its purpose?**  
A feature is the “atomic unit” of functionality or attribute of a product or service, i.e., what it does.

#### Keywords
- create
- edit
- generate
- provide
- enable
- empower
- improve  
(All strong, active verbs that imply a doer.)

#### Examples
- **Edit in the frontend or backend:** With drag and drop, copy and paste, spell checking, and other standard text editing functions.
- **Manipulate images directly in the CMS backend:** Crop and resize images, add frames/borders, watermarks, overlays, and more.
- **Automatically generate responsive images:** Deliver an optimized experience on every screen size.
- **Use the intuitive interface:** Control element positioning and page layout.
- **Bulk edit pages and preview content:** Before publishing.
- **Create dynamic and responsive forms:** With a drag-and-drop form builder.

### Feature Areas
**What is a Feature Area, and what is its purpose?**  
Feature Areas are logical-functional groupings of functionality—collections of Features.
